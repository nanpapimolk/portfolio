This query aims to calculate two key metrics for each region: the average height of the tallest athletes and the percentage of the world's GDP contributed by each region. It achieves this by:

Aggregating Data Using Window Functions: The query employs the ROW_NUMBER() window function to rank athletes by height within each country and select only the tallest athlete for further analysis.
Utilizing Subqueries: A subquery extracts the height of the tallest athlete from each country, which is then used to compute the average height of the tallest athletes by region.
Computing GDP Percentages: The query calculates the percentage of world GDP represented by each region by summing the GDP for each region and dividing it by the total global GDP.
The following code demonstrates this approach:

SELECT
	-- Pull in region and calculate avg tallest height
    region,
    AVG(height) AS avg_tallest,
    -- Calculate region's percent of world gdp
    SUM(SUM(gdp)) OVER(PARTITION BY region)/SUM(SUM(gdp)) OVER() AS perc_world_gdp    
FROM countries AS c
JOIN
    (SELECT 
     	-- Pull in country_id and height
        country_id, 
        height, 
        -- Number the height of each country's athletes
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY country_id ORDER BY height DESC) AS row_num
    FROM winter_games AS w 
    JOIN athletes AS a ON w.athlete_id = a.id
    GROUP BY country_id, height
    -- Alias as subquery
    ORDER BY country_id, height DESC) AS subquery
ON c.id = subquery.country_id
-- Join to country_stats
JOIN country_stats AS cs
ON c.id = cs.country_id
-- Only include the tallest height for each country
WHERE row_num = 1
GROUP BY region;
