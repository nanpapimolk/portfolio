### Analysis of Olympics Dataset

The Olympics dataset comprises two main tables, Summer Games and Winter Games, each containing details about sports events, athletes, and medal counts. Supporting these are additional tables: Countries (id, country, region), Country Stats (year, country_id, gdp, pop_in_billions, nobel_prize_winners), and Athletes (id, name, gender, weight, height).

### Process Overview

The analysis involves:

- **Transforming data with CASE WHEN statements**
- **Aggregating data using functions like COUNT, SUM, and window functions**
- **Combining data through UNION and JOIN operations**
- **Filtering data with WHERE clauses**
- **Sorting data using ORDER BY clauses**

### First Query: Identifying Top Athletes from Nobel Prize-Winning Countries

```sql
-- Pull event and unique athletes from summer_games 
SELECT 
    event,
    CASE WHEN event LIKE '%Women%' THEN 'female' ELSE 'male' END AS gender,
    COUNT(DISTINCT athlete_id) AS athletes
FROM summer_games
-- Only include countries that won a Nobel Prize
WHERE country_id IN 
    (SELECT country_id 
     FROM country_stats 
     WHERE nobel_prize_winners > 0)
GROUP BY event

UNION

SELECT 
    event,
    CASE WHEN event LIKE '%Women%' THEN 'female' ELSE 'male' END AS gender,
    COUNT(DISTINCT athlete_id) AS athletes
FROM winter_games
-- Only include countries that won a Nobel Prize
WHERE country_id IN 
    (SELECT country_id 
     FROM country_stats 
     WHERE nobel_prize_winners > 0)
GROUP BY event

-- Order and limit the final output
ORDER BY athletes DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Second Query: Regional Analysis of Athlete Heights and GDP Contribution

This query calculates two metrics for each region: the average height of the tallest athletes and the percentage of the world's GDP contributed by each region.

```sql
SELECT
    -- Pull in region and calculate average tallest height
    region,
    AVG(height) AS avg_tallest,
    -- Calculate region's percent of world GDP
    SUM(SUM(gdp)) OVER(PARTITION BY region) / SUM(SUM(gdp)) OVER() AS perc_world_gdp
FROM countries AS c
JOIN
    (SELECT 
        country_id, 
        height, 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY country_id ORDER BY height DESC) AS row_num
     FROM winter_games AS w 
     JOIN athletes AS a ON w.athlete_id = a.id
     GROUP BY country_id, height
     ORDER BY country_id, height DESC) AS subquery
ON c.id = subquery.country_id
JOIN country_stats AS cs
ON c.id = cs.country_id
WHERE row_num = 1
GROUP BY region;
```
