# Description

**Data Management with SQL**

This project utilizes SQL (Structured Query Language) for efficient data management and manipulation tasks, including:

- **Transforming data with CASE WHEN statements**
- **Aggregating data using functions like COUNT, SUM, and window functions**
- **Combining data through UNION and JOIN operations**
- **Filtering data with WHERE clauses**
- **Sorting data using ORDER BY clauses**

The project involves working with two datasets:

1. **Olympics Dataset (from Datacamp):** Analyzing sports events, athletes, and medal counts from both Summer and Winter Games tables, along with supporting data like Countries, Country Stats, and Athletes.

2. **Saving Account Dataset (Demonstrate):** Demonstrating SQL operations on banking transactions data, including account details, deposits, withdrawals, and customer information.

This approach aims to showcase SQL's capabilities in handling diverse datasets and performing complex data operations effectively.
