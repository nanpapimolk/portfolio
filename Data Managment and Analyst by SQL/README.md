# Description

Data Management with SQL
The project leverages SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and manipulate data efficiently. SQL is used for tasks such as:

Data Retrieval: Querying databases to fetch specific data.
Data Insertion: Adding new records to the database.
Data Update: Modifying existing records.
Data Deletion: Removing unnecessary records.
Database Management: Creating, altering, and managing database schemas and tables.
Data Analysis: Performing complex queries and aggregations to analyze data patterns and trends.
By using SQL, we ensure robust and scalable data operations, enabling effective data handling and analysis.
