This query seeks to identify the top athletes from countries that have won Nobel Prizes. The process includes:
- Transforming data with CASE WHEN
- Aggregating data using functions like COUNT and SUM
- Combining data through UNION and JOIN operations
- Conditional data with WHERE clause
- Sorting data using ORDER BY
