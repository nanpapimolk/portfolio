# Description

Data Management with SQL
The project leverages SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and manipulate data efficiently. SQL is used for tasks such as:

Data Retrieval: Querying databases to fetch specific data.
Data Insertion: Adding new records to the database.
Data Update: Modifying existing records.
Data Deletion: Removing unnecessary records.
Database Management: Creating, altering, and managing database schemas and tables.
Data Analysis: Performing complex queries and aggregations to analyze data patterns and trends.
By using SQL, we ensure robust and scalable data operations, enabling effective data handling and analysis.


This query seeks to identify the top athletes from countries that have won Nobel Prizes. The process includes:
- Transforming data with CASE WHEN
- Aggregating data using functions like COUNT and SUM
- Combining data through UNION and JOIN operations
- Conditional data with WHERE clause
- Sorting data using ORDER BY
